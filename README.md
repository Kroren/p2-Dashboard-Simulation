### Across theses common dashboards, there are several use case trends:
- Common across all dashboards
    - Speedometer
    - Tachometer 
    - Fuel meter 
    - Temperature
    - Blinkers
    - Odometer
    - Service lights
- Uncommon
    - Digital gear counter (D, P, N, or manual gears on the dash)
    - Oil temperature
    - 
- Rare
    - Turbo pressure (PSI)
    - Oil pressure

### Of the use cases, the user interacts with
- Blinkers
- Spedometer/Tachometer
- Odometer/onboard computer
- Gears

## Improvements to be made
Across many dashboards less modern, I think they could all benefit from merging the tachometer and speedometer into one dial to center the viewer's attention on one particular dial.
