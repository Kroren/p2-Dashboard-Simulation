2020 Honda Civic Si/Type-R
    - Pros
        - Simple, 3 block symmetrical dashboard
        - Important info (Speedometer, Tachometer) are centered in the middle of the viewer's attention
        - Dividers prevent confusion and merging of information
    - Cons
        - Red lines match the gauges and could create some confusion with the extra detail
        - All the ticks on the left and right gauges are the same color
        - Spedometer is not centered, but the turbo pressure is

2019 Nissan 370z
    - Pros
        - Another simple 3-gauge design wit clear dividers
        - Spedometer and tachometer are simple and traditional in their readability
        - Onboard computer screen is big and easy to see.
        - Gear and mode are centered in the tachometer.
    - Cons
        - Fuel gauge is not arced like the speedometer and tachometer, creating a weird inconsistency.
        - Speedometer seems far off to the right, which could be hard to see.
        - Speedometer font is small
        - Odometer is even further right, which is harder to read.
        - Tachometer has a lot of ticks on the inside and outside.

2019 Toyota Camry
    - Pros
        - Simple, easy to understand layout
        - Big, centered meters
        - Less vital gauges are smaller within the main one
        - Large, center onboard computer.
    - Cons
        - Spedometer has a lot of subdivided ticks that might not be needed for the car's intended use.
        - important details on the onboard computer are incredibly small.
        - Colors on the screen do not match the rest of the dashboard.

2018 Dodge Charger
    - Pros
        - Big and easy to read font on the tach and speedo.
        - Two large circular gauges.
        - Symmetrical
        - Bright and easy to see reds on a dark background

        - Absurdly cluttered around the gauges.
        - Everything beside the gauges are almost unreadable.

2018 Ford Fusion
    - Pros
        - Large, centered spedometer.
        - Symmetrical displays
        - Bright colored centere speedo tick
        - Large and centered automatic gearing readings.
    - Cons
        - Digital tachometer incredibly small
        - inconsistent colors and styling between both onboard displays
        - Why would you need to see your radio, when the temp or fuel could be on that display
        - Small spedometer font

### Across theses common dashboards, there are several use case trends:
- Common across all dashboards
    - Speedometer
    - Tachometer 
    - Fuel meter 
    - Temperature
    - Blinkers
    - Odometer
    - Service lights
- Uncommon
    - Digital gear counter (D, P, N, or manual gears on the dash)
    - Mileage/MPG
    - Radio
- Rare
    - Turbo pressure (PSI)
    - Oil pressure
    - Oil temperature

### Of the use cases, the user interacts with
- Blinkers
- Spedometer/Tachometer
- Odometer/onboard computer
- Gears

These use cases must have some sort of user feedback

## Improvements to be made
Across many dashboards less modern, I think they could all benefit from merging the tachometer and speedometer into one dial to center the viewer's attention on one particular dial.  The first examples of the 2020 Civic is, in my opinion, a great example to learn from, which my design will draw inspiration from.

![improvements](https://i.imgur.com/kFqFk9m.png)

 - Speedometer and tach should be the center of the driver's attention
 - Fuel and engine temperature should be at second priority for safety.
 - For potentially vision impared individuals, color-coded alerts should be added.
 - Simple translation of warning lights.
